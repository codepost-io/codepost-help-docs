## Translations

Each language has its own folder in this repo. English in `/en`, Korean in `/ko`, etc. To ensure every help doc points to the same doc in other languages, docs always use their English name. For example, you'll find the following docs
```
/en
  student-signup-instructions.md // contents in English
/ko
  student-signup-instructions.md // contents in Korean
```
